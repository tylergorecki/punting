# NFL Punting Strategy Analysis: Fair Catch vs. Return

## Overview
Using 2021 NFL Big Data Bowl special teams tracking data to analyze the best decisions to make as a returner for each punt, based on where the team is punting from and where the ball is landing. This repository explores the decision-making behind punt returns in college football, specifically analyzing whether opting for a fair catch on every punt provides more strategic benefit compared to attempting a return. The project includes statistical modeling and data analysis to adjust for situational factors and quantify the potential risks and rewards of each option.

## Motivation
Punt returns are high-risk plays that can yield significant yardage but also pose a risk of turnovers and penalties. This project aims to provide evidence-based insights to inform coaching staff on whether prioritizing fair catches can lead to better field position and overall game outcomes.

## Features
- **Comparative Analysis**: Evaluates the outcomes of fair catches versus returns based on field position, game context, and potential yardage gained.
- **Data-Driven Recommendations**: Adjusts for situational variables such as opponent strength and weather to guide decision-making.
- **Risk Assessment**: Quantifies the probability of negative outcomes (e.g., fumbles, penalties) to assess whether returns outweigh the safety of fair catches.

## Technologies Used
- **R**: Used for data manipulation, statistical modeling, and visualization.
- **Libraries**: `tidyverse`, `caret`, `ggplot2`, `dplyr`, `readr`, `shiny` (optional for interactivity).
- **Statistical Techniques**:
  - Logistic regression
  - Descriptive and inferential statistics
  - Data visualization for pattern recognition
