# NFL Punting Project

Using 2021 NFL Big Data Bowl special teams tracking data to analyze the best decisions to make as a returner for each punt, based on where the team is punting from and where the ball is landing. 

Currently the R Shiny dashboard calculates the winning percentage of the return team based on the situation. Our original goal was to create a model that simulated based on fair catch vs. actual result to show what the returner should choose to do but that was never implemented in the app.
